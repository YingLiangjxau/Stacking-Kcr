# Stacking-Kcr
This is the implementation for our paper:
>Stacking-Kcr: A stacking model for predicting the crotonylation sites of lysine by fusing serial and automatic encoder
## Step
>step1:obtain five feature encoding schemes (feature-encoder.7z) based on iLearnPlus.
step2:run AE.py to fuse EGAAC and CKSAAP.
step3:run Stacking.py to get the prediction results.
