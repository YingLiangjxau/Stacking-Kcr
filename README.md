# Stacking-Kcr
This is the implementation for our paper:
>Stacking-Kcr: A stacking model for predicting the crotonylation sites of lysine by fusing serial and automatic encoder
## Step
>step 1: obtain five feature encoding schemes (feature-encoder.7z) by using iLearnPlus (https://github.com/Superzchen/iLearnPlus/).
>step 2: run AE.py to fuse EGAAC and CKSAAP.
>step 3: run Stacking.py to get the prediction results.
